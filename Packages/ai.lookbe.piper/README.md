# piper-unity

A Fast, Local Neural Text-to-Speech System: Piper in Unity for Multi-Platform.

## Overview

**piper-unity** is a high-performance, on-device text-to-speech (TTS) integration for Unity. This version is a specialized fork/port of the [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) project, optimized for real-time applications and game development.

### ⚖️ Why this version?
Unlike the original Piper implementation which relies on `espeak-ng` (GPL Licensed), this repository has been rewritten to be **commercial-friendly** and **performant**:
- **Permissive Licensing**: Removed all GPL-licensed components. 
- **Open Phonemizer**: Replaced `espeak-ng` with a permissive-license phonemizer backend.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Replaced Unity Sentis with [onnxruntime-unity](https://github.com/asus4/onnxruntime-unity) for faster inference speeds and superior platform stability.

## Features

* ✅ **Permissive Stack**: No GPL dependencies—suitable for commercial Unity projects.
* ✅ **High Performance**: Real-time synthesis powered by ONNX Runtime.
* ✅ **Multi-platform**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Android.
* ✅ **Fully Offline**: All processing happens on-device; no internet connection required.
* ✅ **Lightweight**: Optimized neural models perfect for mobile deployment.

---

## Language Support

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Current Version Support:** The current implementation of the Open Phonemizer backend supports **English only**. 
> 
> While the Piper neural engine is capable of many languages, the phoneme conversion layer in this repository is currently optimized for English (`en-us` / `en-gb`). Support for additional languages is planned for future updates as more permissive phoneme dictionaries are integrated.

---

## Requirements

* **Unity**: `6000.0.58f2` (Unity 6) or higher.
* **Inference Engine**: [onnxruntime-unity](https://github.com/asus4/onnxruntime-unity) (v2.2.1+).
* **Phonemizer Resources**: Open Phonemizer ONNX weights and dictionaries.

## Architecture

### 1. Open Phonemizer
The text-to-phoneme conversion is handled by a permissive-license implementation. By utilizing a dedicated ONNX-based tokenizer and phoneme dictionary, we eliminate the legal complexities of `espeak-ng` while maintaining high accuracy for Piper's neural models.

### 2. ONNX Runtime Inference
By using **ONNX Runtime**, this integration provides a highly optimized C++ backend for each platform, ensuring that voice synthesis does not bottleneck the Unity main thread.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
Open your project's `Packages/manifest.json` and update it to include the scoped registry and the Git dependencies.


```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "npm",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [
        "com.github.asus4"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.github.asus4.onnxruntime": "0.4.2",
    "com.github.asus4.onnxruntime.unity": "0.4.2",
    "ai.lookbe.piper": "https://github.com/lookbe/piper-no-espeak-unity.git",

    ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

### 2. Required Model Assets
To run the system, you need two sets of models: the **Phonemizer** (to convert text to phoneme IDs) and the **Piper Voice** (to synthesize audio).

#### A. Phonemizer Assets
Download from [lookbe/open-phonemizer-onnx](https://huggingface.co/lookbe/open-phonemizer-onnx/tree/main):
* `model.onnx`
* `tokenizer.json`
* `phoneme_dict.json`

#### B. Piper Voice Assets
Choose a voice from the official [rhasspy/piper-voices](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main):
1. Select your language and voice (e.g., `en/en_US/amy/low/`).
2. Download **both** the `.onnx` file and the `.onnx.json` file.

---

## Testing

1.  **Import Samples:** Go to the Package Manager, select **Piper TTS Unity**, and import the **BasicPiper** sample.
2.  **Configure Paths:**
    * Select the `PiperTTS` object in the Hierarchy.
    * In the Inspector, locate the **Piper Model Path**, **Piper Config Path**, **Phonemizer Model Path**, **Phonemizer Config Path**, **Phonemizer Dict Path** fields.
    * **Important:** Paste the **absolute path** (e.g., `C:\Models\model.onnx`) for both files.
3.  **Run:** Press Play.

> **Note:** You can extend the component script to use `Application.streamingAssetsPath` if you wish to bundle models with your build, but the core component requires absolute paths for the initial backend load.

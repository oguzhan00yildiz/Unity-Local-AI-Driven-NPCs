## Usage

### Initialization

Before using SparkTTS, you should initialize the factory with your preferred settings:

```csharp
using SparkTTS;
using SparkTTS.Models;
using SparkTTS.Utils;

// Initialize with default settings (Balanced memory usage, CPU execution)
CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize();

// Or customize initialization
CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(
    logLevel: LogLevel.INFO,
    memoryUsage: MemoryUsage.Performance,  // Performance, Balanced, or Optimal
    executionProvider: ExecutionProvider.CoreML  // CPU, CUDA, or CoreML
);
```

#### Memory Usage Modes

SparkTTS supports three memory usage patterns:

- **`MemoryUsage.Performance`**: Loads all models at startup for fastest inference. Higher memory usage (~3GB). Best for desktop applications.
- **`MemoryUsage.Balanced`**: Loads models on demand and keeps them in memory. Good balance of speed and memory usage. (Default)
- **`MemoryUsage.Optimal`**: Loads models on demand and disposes them after use. Lowest memory usage but slower. Best for mobile devices.

#### Waiting for Models to Load (Performance Mode)

When using Performance mode, you may want to wait for all models to finish loading before generating speech:

```csharp
async void Start()
{
    CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(
        LogLevel.INFO, 
        MemoryUsage.Performance,
        ExecutionProvider.CoreML
    );
    
    // Wait for all models to be ready
    await CharacterVoiceFactory.WaitForModelsLoadedAsync();
    
    Debug.Log("All models loaded and ready!");
    
    // Now create voices and generate speech...
}
```

### Basic Voice Generation Using Styles

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using SparkTTS;
using SparkTTS.Utils;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TTSExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private CharacterVoice characterVoice;
    private AudioSource audioSource;

    async void Start()
    {
        // Initialize with Performance mode for fastest inference
        CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(
            LogLevel.INFO, 
            MemoryUsage.Performance,
            ExecutionProvider.CoreML
        );
        
        // Wait for all models to be ready (Performance mode only)
        await CharacterVoiceFactory.WaitForModelsLoadedAsync();
        
        // Get reference to AudioSource
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        
        // Get the singleton instance of the factory
        var voiceFactory = CharacterVoiceFactory.Instance;
        
        // Create a styled voice (gender: male/female, pitch: very_low/low/moderate/high/very_high, speed: very_low/low/moderate/high/very_high)
        characterVoice = await voiceFactory.CreateFromStyleAsync(
            gender: "female",
            pitch: "moderate", 
            speed: "moderate",
            referenceText: "Hello, I am a character voice sample."
        );
        
        // Generate and play speech
        if (characterVoice != null)
        {
            await GenerateAndPlaySpeech("Hello, welcome to my game! I'm an on-device TTS voice.");
        }
    }
    
    public async Task GenerateAndPlaySpeech(string text)
    {
        if (characterVoice == null) return;
        
        AudioClip generatedClip = await characterVoice.GenerateSpeechAsync(text);
        
        if (generatedClip != null && audioSource != null)
        {
            audioSource.clip = generatedClip;
            audioSource.Play();
        }
    }
    
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        // Clean up resources
        characterVoice?.Dispose();
        // Note: Don't dispose the factory instance as it's a singleton
    }
}
```

### Voice Cloning from Reference Audio

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using SparkTTS;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class VoiceCloningExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioClip referenceClip; // Assign in inspector
    private CharacterVoice clonedVoice;
    private AudioSource audioSource;
    
    async void Start()
    {
        // Initialize with Optimal mode for mobile devices
        CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(
            LogLevel.WARNING, 
            MemoryUsage.Optimal,
            ExecutionProvider.CPU
        );
        
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        
        // Get the singleton instance of the factory
        var voiceFactory = CharacterVoiceFactory.Instance;
        
        if (referenceClip != null)
        {
            // Clone voice from reference audio (note: this is async)
            clonedVoice = await voiceFactory.CreateFromReferenceAsync(referenceClip);
            Debug.Log("Voice cloned from reference audio");
        }
    }
    
    public async void SpeakText(string text)
    {
        if (clonedVoice == null) return;
        
        AudioClip generatedClip = await clonedVoice.GenerateSpeechAsync(text);
        
        if (generatedClip != null && audioSource != null)
        {
            audioSource.clip = generatedClip;
            audioSource.Play();
        }
    }
    
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        clonedVoice?.Dispose();
        // Note: Don't dispose the factory instance as it's a singleton
    }
}
```

## Model Deployment Tool

## Model Setup

This package requires Spark-TTS models in the following location:

```
Assets/StreamingAssets/SparkTTS/
  ├── bicodec_encoder_quantizer.onnx
  ├── bicodec_vocoder.onnx
  ├── mel_spectrogram.onnx
  ├── speaker_encoder_tokenizer.onnx
  ├── wav2vec2_model.onnx
  └── LLM/
      ├── model.onnx
      ├── model.onnx_data
      ├── config.json
      ├── generation_config.json
      ├── added_tokens.json
      ├── tokenizer.json
      ├── tokenizer_config.json
      ├── special_tokens_map.json
      ├── vocab.json
      └── merges.txt
```

You can obtain these models by using the `export_sparktts_onnx.py` script from the [Spark-TTS repository](https://github.com/arghyasur1991/Spark-TTS). This script converts the original PyTorch models to ONNX format for use in Unity.

### Exporting Models

1. Clone the Spark-TTS repository: `git clone https://github.com/arghyasur1991/Spark-TTS.git`
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the export script: `python export_sparktts_onnx.py`
4. Copy the `SparkTTS` folder with exported ONNX models inside `onnx_models` to your Unity project's `Assets/Models` directory
5. **Use the Model Deployment Tool** (recommended): Go to `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool` to automatically copy only the required models with optimal precision settings

### Pre-Exported ONNX Models

As an alternative to running the export script, you can download pre-exported ONNX models from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YXj81ApcEasY17a8Zj9RqTpvn4s1UKk7/view?usp=sharing).

1. Download the ZIP file from the link
2. Extract the contents
3. Copy the extracted `SparkTTS` folder with models to your Unity project's `Assets/Models/` directory
4. **Use the Model Deployment Tool** (recommended): Go to `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool` to automatically copy only the required models with optimal precision settings

**Or manually copy**: Copy the `SparkTTS` folder directly to `Assets/StreamingAssets/` (includes all model variants)
